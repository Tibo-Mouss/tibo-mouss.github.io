            &ensp; I currently work at <b>JustWatch</b> as a 
            Software Engineer in the <b>Backend Team</b>.

          <h2 trad="Backend_Developer">Backend Developer</h2>
          <p trad="justwatch_backend_dev_description_1">
            &ensp; I worked on the Golang backend of the website, used by millions of users every week.
            We fetch data from our own databases, a dedicated content internal grpc API, and other
            external APIs and services.
          </p>
          <p trad="justwatch_backend_dev_description_2">
            &ensp; This data is then served to the web/mobile/tv frontend via a graphQL API.

          <p trad="justwatch_devops_description_1">
            &ensp; We are responsible for the deployment of our services, thus having to monitor
            the health of our servers and services, and to ensure that they are running smoothly.
          </p>
          <p trad="justwatch_devops_description_2">
            &ensp; For that we use Grafana, Kubernetes, Google Cloud Monitoring and home made tools.

          <h2 trad="CodeCinema_Presentations"> CodeCinema Presentations </h3>
          <p trad="justwatch_codecinema_description_1">
            &ensp; Every Thursday at JustWatch, we organize <b>CodeCinema</b> sessions,
            where employees give short presentations about work-related or general tech topics.
          </p>
          <p trad="justwatch_codecinema_description_2">
            &ensp; I've had the opportunity to present several CodeCinema sessions on various subjects, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li trad="justwatch_codecinema_topics_1">&ensp; &ensp; • AI & Ecology</li>

          <p trad="justwatch_projects_description">
            &ensp; Between the different small daily tasks, I got assigned different bigger projects :
          </p>
          <br>

          <h3 trad="Justwatch_Repair_TV_Project"> Repair the TV Control from Mobile </h3>
          <p trad="Justwatch_Repair_TV_Project_description_1">
            &ensp; For quite a while the ability to launch a movie on your TV from the Justwatch 
            App on your phone was not working. I was tasked to fix it.
          </p>
          <p trad="Justwatch_Repair_TV_Project_description_2">
            &ensp; I got some explanations to understand the old code, 
            and in the end refactored everything, learned about graphql subscriptions,
            sat up a new Redis Instance and
            got it back to work again, with some more logging to measure how much the 
            feature was being used.
          </p>
          <br>

          <h3 trad="Replaces_all_caches"> Replace all the Caches </h3>
          <p trad="Justwatch_Replaces_all_caches_description_1">
            &ensp; I was tasked to change all cache systems that were relying on ScyllaDB,
            to use Redis instead.
          </p>
          <p trad="Justwatch_Replaces_all_caches_description_2">
            &ensp; The first step was to identify all the repos that were using this Scylla cache. 
            I sat up a grafana dashboard to monitor the cache hit/miss/set rates of the caches, to see
            how it was used in production.
          </p>
          <p trad="Justwatch_Replaces_all_caches_description_3">
            &ensp; I then started, repo by repo, replacing the cache client, while keeping
            everything else intact. This was sometimes tricky as logic could be
            nested inside the client.
          </p>
          <p trad="Justwatch_Replaces_all_caches_description_4">
            &ensp; I tested the repo on stage when possible, and then monitor extremely
            closely when releasing on stage, comparing the scylla grafana Curves with the Redis ones.
          </p>
          <br>

          <h3 trad="PR_Canaries"> PR Canaries </h3>
          <p trad="justwatch_pr_canaries_1">
            &ensp; Frontend at Justwatch is in tight contact with QA, so they do a lot of testing.
            To facilitate testing, they use canaries, which are prod environments used for testing :
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li trad="justwatch_pr_canaries_2_1">&ensp; &ensp; • A feature on a prod like-env. </li>
            <li trad="justwatch_pr_canaries_2_2">&ensp; &ensp; • A feature on a small amount of users. </li>
          </ul>
          <p trad="justwatch_pr_canaries_3">
            &ensp; PR Canaries are meant to have one canary for one Pull Request. 
            Now, Frontend Devs can create Canaries by only clicking on a link that appears
            on a comment everytime they create a PR.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p trad="justwatch_pr_canaries_4">
            &ensp; For this project I had to :
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li trad="justwatch_pr_canaries_5_1">&ensp; &ensp; • Edit/Create Kuberneters deployments/services/configmaps ...</li>
            <li trad="justwatch_pr_canaries_5_2">&ensp; &ensp; • Make Backend, Frontend code edits.</li>
            <li trad="justwatch_pr_canaries_5_3">&ensp; &ensp; • Edit the global webrouter of the website to create canary deployment links.</li>
          </ul>
          <p trad="justwatch_pr_canaries_6">
            &ensp; This was a challenging project as I had to learn a lot about things that were not
            documented, but after a lot of testing it clicked.
          </p>
